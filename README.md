# Framer

## What is it?
A typescript code generator for OpenAPI 3.x that generates:
- Typescript Types
- Data Transfer Objects
- Mockers
- Soon to be, custom generators provided by the consuming project

## Why?
Really this is a venture in learning to swap over to typescript from a javascript developer who is used to the LAMP stack with vanilla JS/react front ends.  On top of that, its a generalized code generator that gives my personal projects a frame to work off of in terms of type safety and will eventually provide a way to insert customized generators for things like react components/state management libs/whatever.  I wasn't a huge fan of the offerings available and wanted to toy around with creating something more minimal that provides guardrails and opportunity for customization.

## Contributing
As of now this is a personal project and will be maintained as such.
